-- Purpose:
-- - Stores details of software applications used or developed within the company.
-- - Provides a structured way to associate projects with specific applications.

DROP TABLE IF EXISTS Applications;

CREATE TABLE Applications (
    ID INTEGER PRIMARY KEY AUTOINCREMENT,
    Name TEXT NOT NULL UNIQUE, -- Application name
    Description TEXT, -- Optional details about the application
    CreatedDate TEXT NOT NULL -- Timestamp when the application was added
);

-- Purpose:
-- - Establishes a many-to-many relationship between Applications and Projects.
-- - Allows multiple projects to belong to multiple applications.

DROP TABLE IF EXISTS ApplicationProjects;

CREATE TABLE ApplicationProjects (
    ApplicationId INTEGER NOT NULL, -- Links to Applications table
    ProjectId INTEGER NOT NULL, -- Links to Projects table
    CreatedDate TEXT NOT NULL, -- Timestamp when the association was created
    PRIMARY KEY (ApplicationId, ProjectId), -- Prevents duplicate associations
    FOREIGN KEY (ApplicationId) REFERENCES Applications(ID) ON DELETE CASCADE,
    FOREIGN KEY (ProjectId) REFERENCES Projects(ID) ON DELETE CASCADE
);

-- Purpose:
-- - Links applications to multiple environments (e.g., an app can exist in Dev, Staging, and Production).
-- - Tracks deployment history, including versioning and deployment dates.

DROP TABLE IF EXISTS ApplicationEnvironments;

CREATE TABLE ApplicationEnvironments (
    ApplicationId INTEGER NOT NULL, -- Links to Applications table
    EnvironmentId INTEGER NOT NULL, -- Links to Environments table
    URL TEXT, -- Optional application URL for the given environment
    LastDeployedVersion TEXT, -- Version last deployed in this environment
    LastDeployedDate TEXT, -- Timestamp of the last deployment
    CreatedDate TEXT NOT NULL, -- When this relationship entry was created
    PRIMARY KEY (ApplicationId, EnvironmentId), -- Ensures unique Application-Environment pair
    FOREIGN KEY (ApplicationId) REFERENCES Applications(ID) ON DELETE CASCADE,
    FOREIGN KEY (EnvironmentId) REFERENCES Environments(ID) ON DELETE CASCADE
);

-- Purpose:
-- - Stores the list of available environments where applications can be deployed.
-- - Ensures consistency in environment names across applications.

DROP TABLE IF EXISTS Environments;

CREATE TABLE Environments (
    ID INTEGER PRIMARY KEY AUTOINCREMENT,
    Name TEXT NOT NULL UNIQUE, -- Environment name (e.g., Development, Staging, Production)
    Description TEXT, -- Optional description of the environment
