);

-- - Allows employees to belong to multiple teams.
-- - Supports team-based assignments and collaboration.

DROP TABLE IF EXISTS TeamMembers;

CREATE TABLE TeamMembers (
    EmployeeId INTEGER NOT NULL, -- Links to Employees table
    TeamId INTEGER NOT NULL, -- Links to Teams table
    CreatedDate TEXT NOT NULL, -- Timestamp when the employee joined the team
    PRIMARY KEY (EmployeeId, TeamId), -- Ensures unique employee-team pairing
